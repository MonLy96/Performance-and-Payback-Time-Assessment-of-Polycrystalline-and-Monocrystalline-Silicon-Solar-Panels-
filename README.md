# Performance-and-Payback-Time-Assessment-of-Polycrystalline-and-Monocrystalline-Silicon-Solar-Panels-
Solar systems suffer from huge initial cost than conventional energy sources but once the solar technologies are The objective of this research is to investigate the efficiency of Crystalline PV Panels under different Cameroon weather conditions using Matlab/Simulink Software, so as to maximize efficiency of Solar Panels while minimizing installation and operation cost.
